The main purpose of the projetc is to analysis the image input data set and classify them into categories.

Import library tensor flow and PyTorch, loading the data set form given website resources: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz , and normalizing it.

Implement an CNN algorithm and model to analysis the loading data and predict the values from the validation dataset, Convert predictions classes to one hot vectors and Convert validation observations to one hot vectors, in the last step compute and output the confusion matrix. By doing: Initialize the MLP with the given activation function and its derivative, number of hidden layers, and number of hidden units per layer, and in this graph data input set i use 0, 1, 2 hidden layers.

Perform hyperparameter tuning, unnormalized training, leaky relu and tanh, and regularization.
